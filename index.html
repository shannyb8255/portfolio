                <p>Hello, I'm Shannon Breault, a soon-to-be graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics (May 2025). My academic journey has strengthened my analytical problem-solving abilities and deepened my understanding of mathematical principles, equipping me with the skills to tackle complex challenges. Throughout my studies, I have worked on projects that bridge mathematics and technology, including a Capability project where I processed data to compute key statistical metrics such as Cp, Cpk, Pp, Ppk, and mean, then automated the organization of these calculations into an Excel spreadsheet. This experience highlights my ability to apply mathematical analysis and programming to real-world applications. I am eager to bring my problem-solving skills and technical expertise to a professional setting, contributing to innovative projects and continuous learning in a math- or tech-related role.</p>

            <h3>ApplyBot – Job Application Automation Tool [Python]</h3>
            <p>A full-stack automation tool designed to streamline the job application process. ApplyBot scrapes job 
                listings from multiple platforms, generates personalized cover letters and emails, and logs all applications 
                to an Excel file. The tool includes a user interface to preview application emails before sending, making it 
                ideal for large-scale job hunting. <br>
                <b>Tech stack:</b> Java, Maven, SerpAPI, Apache POI, JavaMail API, Java Swing <br>
                <b>Highlights:</b> Automatically updates resumes, filters job listings by keywords and location, and provides daily summaries of submitted applications.</p>

            <h3>Capability Calculator [Java/HTML]</h3>
            <p>This is a Capability Calculator designed to analyze process data and generate key statistics, 
                which are then automatically transferred to an Excel spreadsheet for easy download. 
                I use it to evaluate both the potential capability of a process—assuming it’s perfectly centered 
                between its specification limits—and its actual performance by measuring how consistently the process 
                stays within those limits, considering its current average and variation. This helps determine how well <br>
                a process is performing and whether it meets quality standards. 
                <b>Tech stack:</b> Java, Apache POI, Java Swing, Spring Boot <br>
                <b>Highlights:</b> Custom UI for file selection, auto-detection of SPC columns, and export of results 
                to a separate “Capability” sheet in Excel.</p>
