            <p>Hello, I'm Shannon Breault, an aspiring mathematician poised to graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics. My academic journey has been deeply rooted in analytical problem-solving and theoretical exploration, equipping me with a robust foundation in mathematical principles. Throughout my studies, I have engaged in various projects that underscore my passion for applying mathematical concepts to real-world scenarios. Notably, I developed a Downloads Organizerâ€”a tool designed to systematically categorize academic materials into designated class folders, enhancing accessibility and organization. This project reflects my commitment to creating practical solutions through programming and mathematics. I am eager to leverage my mathematical expertise and problem-solving skills in a professional setting, contributing to innovative projects and continuous learning.</p>
