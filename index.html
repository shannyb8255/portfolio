            <p>Hello, I'm Shannon Breault, a soon-to-be graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics (May 2025). My academic journey has strengthened my analytical problem-solving abilities and deepened my understanding of mathematical principles, equipping me with the skills to tackle complex challenges. Throughout my studies, I have worked on projects that bridge mathematics and technology, including a Capability project where I processed data to compute key statistical metrics such as Cp, Cpk, Pp, Ppk, and mean, then automated the organization of these calculations into an Excel spreadsheet. This experience highlights my ability to apply mathematical analysis and programming to real-world applications. I am eager to bring my problem-solving skills and technical expertise to a professional setting, contributing to innovative projects and continuous learning in a math- or tech-related role.</p>
